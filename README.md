## About Me

I’m a graduate student in Applied Data Science at the University of Chicago, with a foundation in computer science and hands-on experience solving business problems through data. My work spans capital markets, telecom networks, and retail operations, with a focus on:

- **End-to-end ML pipelines** from data ingestion to deployment  
- **Applied statistical modeling** with strong foundations in inference and Bayesian methods  
- **NLP and forecasting models** for financial and operational decision-making  
- **Anomaly detection and drift monitoring** for production reliability  
- **Model interpretability and risk scoring** to support business strategy  

I aim to combine **engineering rigor** with **analytical clarity** to create models that are both scalable and explainable.

## Featured Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Financial Alpha from Text** | Built a multi-source pipeline integrating equity data, BERT-based sentiment, and GRU forecasting models. Enhanced directional accuracy and alpha signal quality. |
| **Network Anomaly Detection** | Designed a real-time anomaly detection pipeline using Autoencoders, Isolation Forests, and drift metrics like KL-divergence. Used in a high-throughput telecom setting. |
| **Generative YouTube AI Agents** | Developed a multi-agent generative system for content optimization using LLMs for script, title, and thumbnail generation. Evaluated using Bayesian A/B testing. |
| **Credit Risk Scoring & Explainability** | Built interpretable credit scoring models with SHAP and PDP analysis. Created dashboard interfaces for financial decision-makers. |
| **Readmission Risk Analysis** | Applied statistical testing, survival models, and classification to healthcare data. Designed tools for patient stratification and resource planning. |
